A collection of different machine learning models and code.

# Word Embeddings
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6

## Getting started
Open up a command window and run this command before trying to run the model tester.
```
pip install gensim
```

To start the model tester you can run it using this command
```
python model_tester.py --filename wikipedia_no.model
```

The program has a slight load time before it asks for user input. 
You can now try to write `norge` for example, and it should return the words that are similar to that word. You can also do word operations f.eks. `grave-maskin`.
